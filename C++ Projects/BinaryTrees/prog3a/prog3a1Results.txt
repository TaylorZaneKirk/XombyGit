Now create a simple tree B.

Now cursor is at root node

The tree B after CreateSampletree (inorder):
Leaf:     -3
Interior:   2
Leaf:     -9
Interior:   9
Leaf:     -5

Hit enter to continue

The tree B2 after swapping it with B - should be same as above:
Leaf:     -3
Interior:   2
Leaf:     -9
Interior:   9
Leaf:     -5

Hit enter to continue

The Tree B after change:
Leaf:     -3
Interior:   2
Leaf:     5
Interior:   9
Leaf:     -5

Hit enter to continue
The tree B after removing the leftmost node
Interior:   2
Leaf:     5
Interior:   9
Leaf:     -5

Hit enter to continue
The tree B3 after copying it from one just above:
Interior:   2
Leaf:     5
Interior:   9
Leaf:     -5

Hit enter to continue
The tree B2 before swapping it with B's left subtree - It should be empty:
